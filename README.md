# AndroidSDKLiteServer
A light-weight fake web server for Android SDK Manager, 
so I can download part of the sdk-archive through pr0xy, and put them into the server, 
then install the SDK without access internet. The installation will faster than direct access to Google.<br/>
I write this project cuz I can't access Google without pr0xy(and now still) in Mainland Ch1na, pretty sucks ha!<br/>
